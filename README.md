# Backgound
There are hundreds of visualization tool/library out there can be used to draw graph. It is quite intuitive to throw the data in and the tool/library gives back the graph. In a lot of cases, it is sufficient to work in this way. However, it can be better. 
# Concept
A better visualization tool should accept the raw data and the expectation of the output graph. It will do the data processing in some way automatically to fulfill the requirements and return the graph as expected. The age that users need to pre-process data should be ended by the new way that tool/library takes over the processing job as well as visualization.
